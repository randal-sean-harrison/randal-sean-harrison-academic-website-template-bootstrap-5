         <p>I recognize my presence on the traditional lands of the {tribe} and recognize with respect and reverence
            all tribes,
            nations, and ethnic groups who were the original inhabitants of what is now {sovereign nation}. These lands
            continue
            to carry the stories of their struggles for survival and identity. I honor with gratitude and respect the
            land
            itself
            and those who have stewarded it throughout the generations and continue to do so.
