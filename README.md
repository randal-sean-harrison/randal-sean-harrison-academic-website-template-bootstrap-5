# Free Academic Website Template (Bootstrap v5.3)

This website template is free! I designed it for academicsâ€”everyone from graduate students entering the job market to established faculty. With some modification, it could easily serve as a professional website for professionals in many areas. Because it's designed with the ubiquitous and popular front-end Bootstrap (v5.3) it's easy to modify with my free tool [Bootstrapr.io](https://bootstrapr.io). View the docs for more information and a helpful explainer video on modifying the template.
