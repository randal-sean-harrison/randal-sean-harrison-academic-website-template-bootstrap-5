# Free Academic Website Template (Bootstrap v5.3)

This website template is free! I designed it for academicsâ€”everyone from graduate students entering the job market to established faculty. With some modification, it could easily serve professionals in many areas. 

It's designed with the ubiquitous and popular front-end, Bootstrap (v5.3). And it's even easier to modify with my free <a href="https://bootstrapr.io" target="_blank">Bootstrapr.io</a> app. The documentation ('Docs') has more information and a helpful explainer video on modifying the template.
