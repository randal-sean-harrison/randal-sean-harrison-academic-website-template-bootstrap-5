# Free Academic Website Template (Bootstrap v5.3)

This website template is free! I designed it for academics—everyone from graduate students entering the job market to established faculty. With some modification, it could easily serve professionals in many areas. 

It's designed with the ubiquitous and popular front-end, Bootstrap (v5.3). And it's even easier to modify with my free <a href="https://bootstrapr.io" target="_blank">Bootstrapr.io</a> app. The documentation ('Docs') has more information and a helpful explainer video on modifying the template.
